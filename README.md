# RecursiveSubstrings

A simple Java program that generates all substrings of a given string using recursion. The substrings are returned as semicolon-separated values.

## Features

- Generates all possible substrings of a given string.
- Uses recursion to find the substrings.
- Allows the user to enter multiple words and see the substrings for each.

## Usage

1. The program prompts the user to enter a word.
2. The program generates all substrings of the word and displays them as semicolon-separated values.
3. The user is asked if they want to enter another word to repeat the process.
